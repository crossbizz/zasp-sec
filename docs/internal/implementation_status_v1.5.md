# Agent Security Platform Implementation Status

**Source plan:** `docs/internal/agent_security_platform_Technical_Implementation_Plan_v1.5.md`  
**Source PRD:** `docs/internal/agent_security_platform_PRD_v1.5.md`  
**Last updated:** August 13, 2026  
**Execution branch:** `codex/zasp-implementation`

This file is the authoritative execution status for the 728 microtasks in the
v1.5 technical implementation plan. The plan remains authoritative for scope,
dependencies, deliverables, and verification. A plan task not listed under
In progress, Complete, or Blocked is Pending.

## Status summary

## Execution invariants

- Update this file in the same commit that starts or completes a plan task.
- A task moves from Pending to In progress before implementation begins.
- A task moves to Complete only after its required verification and task review pass.
- A task moves to Blocked only with the exact missing external dependency and evidence.
- Tests, type-check, lint, and production build must pass before a branch push.
- The UI must remain runnable and use product APIs as those contracts become available.
- Existing demo UI is reusable design input, not evidence that a plan task is complete.
- Security-sensitive behavior follows test-first implementation and fails closed.

## Prerequisite work

| ID | Status | Purpose | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PRE-01 | Complete | Restored a clean, reproducible UI quality baseline before M0 work. | Node 22.23.1/npm 10.9.8 install, tests, type-check, lint, and production build pass without errors. |
| PRE-02 | Complete | Added a push and pull-request quality gate that enforces the runnable-UI invariant. | CI uses Node 22.23.1/npm 10.9.8, performs the locked install, and runs the root verification command. |

## In progress

No source-plan task is in progress.

## Complete

| Task | Completed | Deliverable | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M0-01 | August 13, 2026 | MVP external and OSS risk register with explicit pass/fail exit criteria. | Register names every required uncertainty; each has an objective PASS/FAIL criterion, owner/decision consequence, and `Not run` initial status. |

`PRE-01` and `PRE-02` are complete prerequisite work and do not complete a
source-plan microtask.

## Blocked

No source-plan task is blocked.

## Deferred findings

| Source | Finding | Ruling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prerequisite final review | Runnable UI workflow pins immutable but older v4 GitHub Action SHAs; the ignored review report mislabels the checkout release. | Non-load-bearing for M0 and the current UI gate. Refresh to current verified SHAs during release/dependency hardening before merge. |

## Execution notes

- The pre-existing UI is a browser-local prototype. It currently persists demo
  actions in local storage and does not call the product API.
- The repository passed 20 tests, type-check, and production build under Node
  22.23.1 at preflight. Lint reported 37 errors and is part of `PRE-01`.
- Node 26 exposes an experimental global `localStorage` that conflicts with the
  current Vitest DOM setup. The project uses Node 22 types and is pinned to
  verified Node 22.23.1 as part of completed `PRE-01`.
- On hosts with Homebrew libvips, dependency installation must set
  `SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1` so the locked Sharp binary is used.
- `PRE-01` completed with pinned Node 22.23.1/npm 10.9.8, a root verification
  command, and a clean lint baseline. No source-plan task status changed.
- `PRE-02` completed with a GitHub Actions gate for pushes and pull requests.
  It pins Node 22.23.1/npm 10.9.8, uses the documented locked install, and
  runs `npm run verify`; a parsed-workflow test protects that contract.
